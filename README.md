# TCG Order Management API Demo

This repository contains a demonstration of modern C# and .NET backend development practices in a microservice-based architecture. The application showcases implementation of industry standard patterns, security best practices, and modern software development techniques through a RESTful API without frontend components.

## Project Purpose

This API-only demo serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate:

1. **C# & .NET Backend Expertise**: Showcasing proficiency with .NET Framework 4.0 and C# 7.0 in building robust, scalable APIs
2. **Microservice Architecture Design**: Implementing domain-driven microservices with clear boundaries
3. **Database Integration Skills**: Working with both SQL Server and MongoDB for different data storage needs
4. **API Development Best Practices**: RESTful design, proper status codes, validation, and documentation
5. **Advanced Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, and secure data handling
6. **Event-Driven Communication**: Using RabbitMQ for service-to-service communication

The project is specifically designed to highlight backend development capabilities for trading card game (TCG) marketplace systems.

## Project Structure

The portfolio is organized into several backend microservices:

- **OrderService**: Handles order processing and management
- **InventoryService**: Manages product inventory and availability
- **PaymentService**: Processes payments and financial transactions
- **ShippingService**: Manages shipping logistics and fulfillment
- **NotificationService**: Handles user notifications and communication

## Technology Stack

- **.NET Framework 4.0**
- **C# 7.0**
- **SQL Server**: Primary relational database
- **MongoDB**: Document database for inventory data
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for service communication
- **Dapper**: Lightweight ORM for data access
- **AutoMapper**: Object-to-object mapping
- **NLog**: Comprehensive logging
- **MSTest**: Unit and integration testing
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation and testing interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2019 or newer
- .NET Framework 4.0 SDK
- SQL Server 2019 (Developer Edition)
- MongoDB 4.4+
- RabbitMQ 3.8+

### Running the Services

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Restore NuGet packages
4. Update connection strings in `appsettings.json` files
5. Run database migrations:
   ```
   Update-Database -Project OrderService
   ```
6. Start the services in the following order:
   - RabbitMQ
   - InventoryService
   - PaymentService
   - ShippingService
   - NotificationService
   - OrderService

7. Access the API documentation at `https://localhost:5001/` using Swagger UI

## API Features

- **Order Processing**: End-to-end order workflow via RESTful endpoints
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time tracking and reservation APIs
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment handling endpoints
- **Shipping Integration**: Seamless shipping options through API
- **Real-time Notifications**: Event-based notification system
- **Comprehensive Security**: Authentication, encryption, and secure coding practices

## Architecture

The application follows a microservice architecture pattern with the following key principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services organized around business capabilities
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through events via message broker
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separation of read and write operations
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction of data access logic
- **RESTful API Design**: Following REST best practices for all endpoints

For a detailed overview of the implementation, see [Implementation Overview](docs/implementation-overview.md).

## Security

This API demo demonstrates enterprise-grade security practices:

- JWT-based authentication
- Secure password storage with BCrypt
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Secure configuration management

## Testing

The application includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing interaction between components
- **API Tests**: Testing endpoints and API contracts

## Future Improvements

- Implement API Gateway for unified entry point
- Add containerization with Docker
- Enhance monitoring and observability
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Add performance testing and optimization
- Develop a complementary frontend client application
