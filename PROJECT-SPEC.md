# TCG Order Management System - Demo Project

## Project Overview

This demo project showcases C# expertise and system design skills relevant to the TCGplayer Software Engineer position. It implements a simplified trading card game order management system using .NET Framework 4.0, demonstrating proficiency with the core technologies required by the role.

## Project Goals

1. Demonstrate C# fluency and .NET Framework expertise
2. Showcase database integration with both SQL Server and NoSQL stores
3. Implement a microservice architecture pattern with clear service boundaries
4. Feature event-driven communication between services
5. Create a comprehensive order management workflow
6. Include monitoring and performance optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Order Management Service** (C# / .NET Framework 4.0)
   - Processes incoming orders
   - Manages order state transitions
   - Implements business logic for validation and routing

2. **Inventory Service** (C# / .NET Framework 4.0)
   - Tracks card inventory and availability
   - Handles reservations and stock updates
   - Maintains card metadata and pricing

3. **Fulfillment Service** (C# / .NET Framework 4.0)
   - Manages picking, packing, and shipping processes
   - Tracks fulfillment status
   - Handles shipping provider integration

4. **Message Bus / Event Broker**
   - Facilitates communication between services
   - Implements message delivery guarantee patterns
   - Demonstrates event-driven architecture principles

### Data Storage

1. **SQL Server Database**
   - Order tables with normalized structure
   - Customer information
   - Transaction history
   - Optimized queries for high-volume scenarios

2. **NoSQL Store (MongoDB)**
   - Card catalog with complex metadata
   - Inventory snapshots
   - Search optimization

3. **Redis Cache**
   - Frequently accessed inventory data
   - Session information
   - Performance optimization for high-traffic endpoints

### API Layer

1. **RESTful API Endpoints**
   - Order creation, updating, and tracking
   - Inventory queries
   - Seller management
   - Structured documentation with Swagger

2. **Internal Service Communication**
   - Event-based messaging for asynchronous processes
   - Direct API calls for synchronous operations
   - Circuit breaker patterns for resilience

## Key Features to Highlight

### 1. Order Processing Workflow

- Multi-step order processing pipeline
- State transition management and validation
- Transaction handling across database systems
- Event publishing for each state change

### 2. Inventory Management

- Real-time inventory updates
- Reservation system for in-progress orders
- Handling of edge cases (overselling, returns, cancellations)
- Efficient query patterns for large catalogs

### 3. Microservice Design

- Clear domain boundaries
- Independent deployability
- Proper service communication patterns
- Data consistency across service boundaries

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Efficient database access patterns
- Caching strategies
- Query optimization
- Bulk operation handling

### 5. Monitoring & Logging

- Structured logging implementation
- Performance tracking
- Error handling and reporting
- Metrics collection
