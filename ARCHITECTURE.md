# TCG Order Management System - Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design of the TCG Order Management System API, detailing the backend components, their interactions, and the rationale behind key design decisions. This is an API-only demonstration without frontend components, designed to showcase backend development expertise in building scalable and maintainable microservice architectures.

## System Overview

The TCG Order Management System is designed as a set of loosely coupled microservices that handle different aspects of managing orders for a trading card game marketplace. Each service is responsible for a specific domain and communicates with other services through well-defined interfaces.

The system is designed as a microservices architecture with three core services:

1. **Order Service**
2. **Inventory Service** 
3. **Fulfillment Service**

These services communicate through both synchronous API calls and asynchronous event-based messaging.

## Communication Patterns

The system employs both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns:

### Synchronous Communication

- RESTful APIs for direct service-to-service communication
- Used for operations requiring immediate response
- Implemented with circuit breaker patterns for resilience

### Asynchronous Communication

- Event-based messaging for state change notifications
- Publish-subscribe pattern for decoupled communication
- At-least-once delivery semantics
- Idempotent event handlers for reliability

## Event Flow Examples

### Order Placement Flow

1. Customer places order via Order Service
2. Order Service validates order details
3. Order Service publishes `OrderCreated` event
4. Inventory Service subscribes to `OrderCreated` event
5. Inventory Service reserves items and publishes `InventoryReserved` event
6. Order Service processes payment upon receiving `InventoryReserved`
7. Order Service publishes `OrderConfirmed` event
8. Fulfillment Service subscribes to `OrderConfirmed` event
9. Fulfillment Service creates picking list and begins fulfillment process

### Inventory Update Flow

1. Inventory levels updated in Inventory Service
2. Inventory Service publishes `InventoryChanged` event
3. Order Service subscribes to update product availability information
4. Fulfillment Service may subscribe to adjust picking strategies for low-stock items

## Data Persistence Strategy
