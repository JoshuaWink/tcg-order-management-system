# Security and Best Practices Validation

This document outlines security requirements and best practices for the TCG Order Management System. It serves as a validation checklist to ensure the system follows modern security standards and industry best practices.

## Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Strong authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, JWT, etc.)
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication support
- [ ] Proper role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Principle of least privilege in role assignments
- [ ] Session management (secure tokens, proper timeout)
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Secure password policies (complexity, rotation)
- [ ] Secure credential storage (hashing with strong algorithms)

## Data Protection

- [ ] Encryption of sensitive data at rest (PII, payment details)
- [ ] Encryption of data in transit (TLS 1.3)
- [ ] Secure key management practices
- [ ] Data minimization (collecting only necessary data)
- [ ] Proper PII handling and protection
- [ ] Database encryption
- [ ] Secure backup procedures

## API and Input Security

- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Output encoding to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] API request validation
- [ ] Protection against common attacks (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- [ ] API authentication and authorization
- [ ] Parameter validation and sanitization
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Communication Security

- [ ] TLS for all external communications
- [ ] Secure internal service communication
- [ ] Certificate validation
- [ ] Proper cipher suite configuration
- [ ] Certificate rotation policies
- [ ] Network segregation between services

## Error Handling and Logging

- [ ] Secure error handling (no sensitive data in errors)
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of security events
- [ ] Log protection and integrity
- [ ] Proper log retention policies
- [ ] Centralized log management
- [ ] Monitoring for security events

## Dependency Management

- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- [ ] Software composition analysis
- [ ] Secure dependency sources
- [ ] Build-time security checks

## Infrastructure Protection

- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- [ ] Resource quotas for services
- [ ] Circuit breakers for resilience
- [ ] Infrastructure monitoring
- [ ] Proper container security (if applicable)
- [ ] Secure cloud configuration (if applicable)

## Microservice-Specific Security

- [ ] Service-to-service authentication
- [ ] Secure service discovery
- [ ] Per-service security policies
- [ ] Secure configuration management
- [ ] Secrets management
- [ ] Container security (if using containers)

## Database Security

- [ ] Least privilege database users
- [ ] Secure connection strings handling
- [ ] Parameterized queries to prevent injection
- [ ] Data encryption
- [ ] Database activity monitoring
- [ ] Regular security audits

## Message Queue Security

- [ ] Authentication for queue access
- [ ] Authorization for publishing/subscribing
- [ ] Encrypted messages for sensitive data
- [ ] TLS for queue connections
- [ ] Queue access auditing
- [ ] Message validation

## Compliance and Privacy

- [ ] Compliance with relevant regulations (PCI-DSS for payment, etc.)
- [ ] Privacy controls
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Right to be forgotten mechanisms
- [ ] Consent management

## DevOps and CI/CD Security

- [ ] Secure CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Infrastructure as code security scanning
- [ ] Automated security testing
- [ ] Deployment approval processes
- [ ] Environment segregation

## Incident Response

- [ ] Incident response plan
- [ ] Security monitoring
- [ ] Alerting mechanisms
- [ ] Defined security contacts
- [ ] Vulnerability disclosure policy

## Code Quality and Security

- [ ] Security code reviews
- [ ] Static analysis tools
- [ ] Dynamic security testing
- [ ] Secure coding guidelines
- [ ] Security training for developers

## Environment-Specific Security

### Development Environment
- [ ] Isolated from production data
- [ ] Developer access controls
- [ ] Secure developer workstations

### Testing/Staging Environment
- [ ] Mimics production security controls
- [ ] Sanitized test data
- [ ] Separate credentials from production

### Production Environment
- [ ] Strict access controls
- [ ] Change management processes
- [ ] Continuous monitoring
- [ ] Regular security assessments
