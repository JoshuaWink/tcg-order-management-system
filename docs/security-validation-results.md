  - Using industry-standard work factor (12) for balance of security and performance

## Data Protection

- [ ] Data minimization
  - Not explicitly implemented
  
- [x] Proper PII handling and protection
  - PII fields are encrypted at rest using AES-256
  - Access to decrypted values is controlled through service methods

## API and Input Security

- [x] Input validation on user inputs
  - Data annotations are used for validation in model classes
  - Some business logic validation in services
  
- [ ] Output encoding to prevent XSS
  - Not explicitly implemented
  
- [x] API request validation
  - Model validation is applied
  
- [x] Protection against SQL injection
  - Parameterized queries are used consistently
  - No string concatenation for SQL queries
  
- [x] API authentication and authorization
  - JWT authentication is implemented
  - Role-based authorization is applied to controllers

## Communication Security

- [x] TLS for external communications
  - HTTPS redirection is enforced
  
- [x] Secure internal service communication
  - RabbitMQ supports TLS and is configured with credentials
  
- [ ] Certificate validation
  - No explicit certificate validation code

## Error Handling and Logging

- [x] Secure error handling
  - Global exception handling middleware
  - Custom error responses that don't expose sensitive details
  
- [x] Comprehensive logging of security events
  - User authentication events are logged
  - Critical operations are logged
  
- [ ] Log protection and integrity
  - No evidence of specific log protection measures
  
- [x] Centralized log management
  - References to Application Process Monitoring (APM) tools like Scalyr/DataSet

## Dependency Management

- [ ] Regular dependency updates
  - No evidence of dependency management policies
  
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning
  - No evidence of security scanning tools

## Microservice-Specific Security

- [x] Service-to-service authentication
  - RabbitMQ uses credentials for authentication
  
- [x] Secure configuration management
  - Environment variables are used for configuration
  - Validation of configuration values

## Database Security

- [x] Secure connection strings handling
  - Connection strings use environment variables
  - No hardcoded credentials in code
  
- [x] Parameterized queries
  - SQL parameters are consistently used
  - No string concatenation for dynamic queries
  
- [ ] Database encryption
  - No evidence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for database connections

## Message Queue Security

- [x] Authentication for queue access
  - RabbitMQ configuration includes username and password
  
- [ ] Encrypted messages
  - Messages are not encrypted before publishing

## Recommendations

Based on our security validation, the following improvements are recommended:

1. **Password Security**
   - Implement proper password hashing with salt using a secure algorithm (bcrypt, Argon2)
   - Replace current SHA-256 implementation

2. **Data Protection**
   - Implement data encryption at rest for sensitive information
   - Establish clear policies for PII handling

3. **Authentication Enhancements**
   - Implement account lockout mechanisms
   - Consider multi-factor authentication support

4. **Security Monitoring**
   - Implement more comprehensive security event logging
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Establish regular dependency update procedures
   - Implement vulnerability scanning as part of CI/CD

6. **Message Security**
   - Consider encrypting sensitive data in RabbitMQ messages
   - Implement message validation

## Conclusion

The TCG Order Management System implements several important security measures, particularly around authentication, authorization, and SQL injection prevention. However, there are significant areas for improvement, especially in password storage, data encryption, and comprehensive security monitoring. Addressing these recommendations would substantially improve the security posture of the application.
